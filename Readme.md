Detecting Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning

**Project Description:**

More than 10 million people are living with Parkinson’s Disease worldwide, according to the Parkinson’s Foundation. While Parkinson’s cannot be cured, early detection along with proper medication can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life.

The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the pen pressure is lower among Parkinson’s patients. One of the indications of Parkinson’s is tremors and rigidity in the muscles, making it difficult to draw smooth spirals and waves. It is possible to detect Parkinson’s disease using the drawings alone instead of measuring the speed and pressure of the pen on paper. Our goal is to quantify the visual appearance(using HOG method) of these drawings and then train a machine learning model to classify them. In this project, We are using, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) image descriptor along with a Random Forest classifier to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.

**Project objective**

“*” To understand the problem for to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.
“*” To pre-process the image by using different data pre-processing techniques.
“*” To implement the algorithm by using OpenCV framework and machine learning to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.
“*” To know how to find the accuracy of the model.
“*” To build web application using the Flask framework that features the detection of Parkinson's Disease.
